# About ÐEARS

ÐEARS is a social experiment in measuring, exchanging, creating, recording and holding value in common. 


ÐEARS is a community currency experiment deployed within the After School, a translocal network of cultural researchers, artists, activists and designers convened by the Center for Arts, Design and Social Research. 


ÐEARS is offered to its members as a convivial tool to keep value circulating within our community.

## What if

What if all the After School fellows brought our intangible and tangible wares to a sort of town square with the intention of finding ways to generate an internal economy of compounding value? And what if we had a currency that could power our collective work with the spirit of a local market, without atomizing the community or reducing our relations down to those of clients and vendors? What happens if we each offer something to the community, and accept compensation in ÐEARS instead of dollars, shillings, and euros?

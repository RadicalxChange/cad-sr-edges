# About ÐEARS

ÐEARS is a social experiment in measuring, exchanging, creating, recording and holding value in common. 

ÐEARS is a community currency experiment deployed within the After School, a translocal network of cultural researchers, artists, activists and designers convened by the Center for Arts, Design and Social Research. 

ÐEARS is offered to its members as a convivial tool to keep value circulating within our community.

## What

Complementary (local) currencies that are intentionally more valuable *inside* a community than *outside* it mitigate money’s community-eroding, “centrifugal” quality. 

ÐEARS is a social experiment in creating a trust-based complementary currency system. If it works, it could help this community collaborate more easily, strengthen social bonds, and cohere around projects that produce common goods. We've forked a simple app developed by RadicalxChange and laid out a series of incentives that we hope will create a flywheel of collaboration.

## How

A critical ingredient in ÐEARS is trust. Accordingly, the “commons fund” is a simple trust pool. If you’d like to become a “member” of the system, you’ll need to go through our onboarding process. From the very beginning, we’re relying on our social ties and counting on each other to act in good faith.

Second, if you want to send ÐEARS to non-members, you can – but you have to pay an “exit tax”. This forms a kind of membrane around the currency system, encouraging us to think about how to serve local rather than global needs.

Third, ÐEARS should be used mainly to compensate and/or recognize contributions of time and effort – not exchanges for durable assets. Durable assets are a kind of “global money” since they can be easily resold outside the community; buying them is therefore a kind of “exit”. The purpose of each transaction is recorded in an honor-system ledger that only members can see.

Thus, to accept ÐEARS, or to offer services in exchange for ÐEARS, means something. It signals trust in the potential of the community and desire for integration into it. To be rich in ÐEARS means that you’ve done things for others around here; it’s a more meaningful signal than wealth in global money, which easily crosses and punctures social contexts.

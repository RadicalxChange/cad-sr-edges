## Why

Picture a non-hierarchical group of people hanging out and collaborating. Now picture that group of people paying each other for time and work. In one sense, this will make them better able to collaborate on substantial projects, but in another sense, it will erode their identity as a “community”.

This, we believe, is because conventional money (fiat, crypto, gold, ETFs, etc) is a “global” rather than “local” measure of value. Precisely because money’s value is easily recognized outside the community, holding money encourages people to think less about the community’s wants and needs. Accumulating money reduces not only individuals’ dependence on community, but also their commitment to it.

This is a problem for intentional communities that want to take on ambitious projects. They are between a rock and a hard place: If they don’t use money internally, they have trouble scaling collaboration, but if they do use it, they lose their identity as communities.

We are interested in developing community currency systems that find the optima in this dilemma.

ÐEARS is a community currency experiment deployed within the After School, a translocal network of cultural researchers, artists, activists and designers convened by the Center for Arts, Design and Social Research. 

ÐEARS is offered as a convivial tool that enhances community participation and agency in co-creating intentional economies that meet the needs, scale and aspirations of its members.

## What

Complementary currencies that are intentionally more valuable *inside* a community than *outside* it mitigate money’s community-eroding, “centrifugal” quality. That’s what we’re hoping to build.

ÐEARS is a social experiment in creating a non-crypto, trust-based complementary currency system. If it works, it could help the this community collaborate and scale without losing coherence and commitment. ÐEARS also might be worth something, although that value will be differentially realizable *within* this community. We’ve built a simple app and laid out a series of incentives that we hope will create a flywheel of collaboration.

This only works with a game community – so we hope you’ll join us!

## How

A critical ingredient in ÐEARS is trust. Accordingly, the “central bank” is a simple trust pool. If you’d like to become a “member” of the system, you’ll need to go through our onboarding process. From the very beginning, we’re relying on our social ties and counting on each other to act in good faith.

Second, if you want to send ÐEARS to non-members, you can – but you have to pay an “exit tax”. This forms a kind of membrane around the currency system, encouraging us to think about how to serve local rather than global needs.

Third, ÐEARS should be used mainly to compensate and/or recognize contributions of time and effort – not exchanges for durable assets. Durable assets are a kind of “global money” since they can be easily resold outside the community; buying them is therefore a kind of “exit”. The purpose of each transaction is recorded in an honor-system ledger that only members can see.

Thus, to accept ÐEARS, or to offer services in exchange for ÐEARS, means something. It signals trust in the potential of the community and desire for integration into it. To be rich in ÐEARS means that you’ve done things for others around here; it’s a more meaningful signal than wealth in global money, which easily crosses and punctures social contexts.
